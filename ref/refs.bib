  abstract =                   {{Highly reduced and ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays have been fabricated
   using two-step anodization and three-electrode reduction. A
   proton-electron coupled reduction mechanism has been proposed based on
   the combined paradigms of a conventional energy-band model and chemical
   evolution of basic building blocks of TiO2. Under optimized reduction
   conditions, about 22\% of Ti4+ ions in tube surface regions are
   converted into Ti3+ ions while the morphology of the highly reduced TiO2
   nanotube arrays keeps unchanged. The reduced nanotube arrays show
   superior electrochemical properties such as high areal capacitance, good
   rate capability, and high cycling stability. The areal capacitance of
   the reduced electrode is 24.07 mF cm(-2) at a scan rate of 10 mV s(-1),
   much higher than that of the pristine TiO2 nanotube arrays (0.02 mF
   cm(-2)). This kind of highly reduced one-dimensional oxide
   nanostructures can find a large array of applications in
   supercapacitors, photocatalysis, electrochromic display, and Li ion
   batteries. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

  abstract =                   {{It is well known anodic TiO2 nanotubes (ATNTs) can be obtained by the
   anodization of Ti foils in fluoride-containing solutions, and the
   nanotube diameter is proportional to the applied voltages. However, the
   growth kinetics of ATNTs and the relationship between structural
   features and anodizing parameters still remain unclear. Challenges
   always remain in the fabrication of ATNTs with large diameters due to
   the undesired breakdown event under the high voltage in NH4F solutions.
   Here, an interesting approach is first proposed to overcome these
   particular challenges. A series of constant current anodizing processes
   in fluoride-free H3PO4 solutions, NH4F solutions of different
   concentrations (0.7 wt\%, 0.5 wt\% and 0.2 wt \%), and different mixed
   electrolytes containing both NH4F and H3PO4, have been compared in
   detail. And we mainly focused on the influence of the different ratios
   of NH4F and H3PO4 on the outer diameters of ATNTs and the correlation
   between two types of films. The interesting results show that the
   nanotube diameter greatly increases with H3PO4 amount in the solutions
   with a given concentration of NH4F. In contrast, the nanotube length
   decreases with the increase of H3PO4 amount in the solutions with a
   given concentration of NH4F. The experimental findings and the undesired
   breakdown phenomenon can be elucidated by the theory of the electronic
   current and ionic current rather than by the field-assisted dissolution.

   were successfully fabricated by electrochemical anodization in ethylene
   glycol-based electrolytes with various NH4F concentrations. Hydrogen
   production by photocatalytic water splitting was performed in a
   two-compartment photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell without any applied
   voltage. The effect of NH4F concentration on the morphological
   structure, PEC performance and hydrogen evolution of TiO2 samples were
   systematically investigated. TiO2 anodized with 0.50 wt\% of NH4F
   concentration for 60 min exhibited highest hydrogen evolution of 2.53 mL
   h(-1) cm(-2) and maximum photoconversion efficiency of 4.39\%. Based on
   the above results and the different current-time curves during
   anodization processes, another series of TiO2 nanotube arrays samples
   with the equal charge consumption (designated as TiO2 Nts-EC) were
   synthesized by controlling the anodization time in electrolytes
   containing different NH4F concentrations. Compared with TiO2 Nts
   prepared at the same NH4F concentration for 60 min, hydrogen production
   and PEC properties of TiO2 Nts-EC samples have been obviously enhanced,
   especially for the sample prepared at 1.25 wt\% NH4F concentrations.
   Moreover, despite the difference of NH4F concentration in electrolyte,
   the TiO2 Nts-EC samples exhibit comparable PEC performances. These
   results indicated that the anodization charge-density play a crucial
   role in the hydrogen generation of TiO2 Nts. The results benefit the
   enhancement of the hydrogen production of TiO2 Nts. (C) 2015 Elsevier

  abstract =                   {{Nanoporous anodic titanium oxide (ATO) layers with different cell sizes,
   pore diameters and the thicknesses are successfully grown by three-step
   self-organized anodization in ethylene glycol containing 0.38 wt\% of
   NH4F and 1.79 wt\% of H2O at applied potential differences ranging from
   30 V to 70 V at various electrolyte temperatures. A relatively high
   growth speed (about 40 mu m h(-1)) of nanopore arrays is achieved at 30
   degrees C under the potential difference of 70 V. The morphology and the
   structure of ATO layers are directly affected by anodizing conditions,
   especially temperature and potential difference. It was found that the
   oxide thickness and the cell size are linearly dependent on anodizing
   potential difference. On the other hand, the anodizing temperature in
   the range of 10-30 degrees C does not affect the cell size in ATO films.
   Analyses of the pore diameter, pore circularity and regularity of the
   pore arrangement suggests that nanoporous anodic titania with the best
   pore arrangement can be formed in a controlled manner by anodization
   performed at 50 V and 20 degrees C. Surprisingly, below and above this
   critical potential difference and temperature, pore diameters are
   smaller and obtained ATO structures are less regular. At higher
   anodizing temperatures, the regularity of pore arrangement observed at
   the surface and the pore diameter are considerably affected by the
   precipitated hydrous titanium dioxide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   changes accompanying the formation of porous anodic films on titanium in
   0.5 wt \% NH(4)F in glycerol are investigated. The findings reveal
   amorphous films with nanotubes of TiO(2), containing fluoride ions and
   possibly glycerol derivatives. Tungsten and titanium species are lost to
   the electrolyte at differing rates during anodizing, leading to an
   enrichment of tungsten in the film relative to the composition of the
   substrate. The spacing of tungsten-containing bands in the film is
   similar to 2.3 that of the original alloy layers during growth of the
   major pores. The generation of the nanotubes can be explained either by
   field-assisted flow of film material within the barrier layer to the
   pore walls, with cation and anion transport numbers of anodic titania in
   the barrier layer region similar to those of barrier films and with
   field-assisted ejection of Ti(4+) ions to the electrolyte, or by
   field-assisted dissolution, but with a reduction in cation transport
