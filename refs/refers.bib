  abstract =                   {{Highly reduced and ordered TiO2 nanotube arrays have been fabricated
   using two-step anodization and three-electrode reduction. A
   proton-electron coupled reduction mechanism has been proposed based on
   the combined paradigms of a conventional energy-band model and chemical
   evolution of basic building blocks of TiO2. Under optimized reduction
   conditions, about 22\% of Ti4+ ions in tube surface regions are
   converted into Ti3+ ions while the morphology of the highly reduced TiO2
   nanotube arrays keeps unchanged. The reduced nanotube arrays show
   superior electrochemical properties such as high areal capacitance, good
   rate capability, and high cycling stability. The areal capacitance of
   the reduced electrode is 24.07 mF cm(-2) at a scan rate of 10 mV s(-1),
   much higher than that of the pristine TiO2 nanotube arrays (0.02 mF
   cm(-2)). This kind of highly reduced one-dimensional oxide
   nanostructures can find a large array of applications in
   supercapacitors, photocatalysis, electrochromic display, and Li ion
   batteries. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},

  abstract =                   {{It is well known anodic TiO2 nanotubes (ATNTs) can be obtained by the
   anodization of Ti foils in fluoride-containing solutions, and the
   nanotube diameter is proportional to the applied voltages. However, the
   growth kinetics of ATNTs and the relationship between structural
   features and anodizing parameters still remain unclear. Challenges
   always remain in the fabrication of ATNTs with large diameters due to
   the undesired breakdown event under the high voltage in NH4F solutions.
   Here, an interesting approach is first proposed to overcome these
   particular challenges. A series of constant current anodizing processes
   in fluoride-free H3PO4 solutions, NH4F solutions of different
   concentrations (0.7 wt\%, 0.5 wt\% and 0.2 wt \%), and different mixed
   electrolytes containing both NH4F and H3PO4, have been compared in
   detail. And we mainly focused on the influence of the different ratios
   of NH4F and H3PO4 on the outer diameters of ATNTs and the correlation
   between two types of films. The interesting results show that the
   nanotube diameter greatly increases with H3PO4 amount in the solutions
   with a given concentration of NH4F. In contrast, the nanotube length
   decreases with the increase of H3PO4 amount in the solutions with a
   given concentration of NH4F. The experimental findings and the undesired
   breakdown phenomenon can be elucidated by the theory of the electronic
   current and ionic current rather than by the field-assisted dissolution.

   were successfully fabricated by electrochemical anodization in ethylene
   glycol-based electrolytes with various NH4F concentrations. Hydrogen
   production by photocatalytic water splitting was performed in a
   two-compartment photoelectrochemical (PEC) cell without any applied
   voltage. The effect of NH4F concentration on the morphological
   structure, PEC performance and hydrogen evolution of TiO2 samples were
   systematically investigated. TiO2 anodized with 0.50 wt\% of NH4F
   concentration for 60 min exhibited highest hydrogen evolution of 2.53 mL
   h(-1) cm(-2) and maximum photoconversion efficiency of 4.39\%. Based on
   the above results and the different current-time curves during
   anodization processes, another series of TiO2 nanotube arrays samples
   with the equal charge consumption (designated as TiO2 Nts-EC) were
   synthesized by controlling the anodization time in electrolytes
   containing different NH4F concentrations. Compared with TiO2 Nts
   prepared at the same NH4F concentration for 60 min, hydrogen production
   and PEC properties of TiO2 Nts-EC samples have been obviously enhanced,
   especially for the sample prepared at 1.25 wt\% NH4F concentrations.
   Moreover, despite the difference of NH4F concentration in electrolyte,
   the TiO2 Nts-EC samples exhibit comparable PEC performances. These
   results indicated that the anodization charge-density play a crucial
   role in the hydrogen generation of TiO2 Nts. The results benefit the
   enhancement of the hydrogen production of TiO2 Nts. (C) 2015 Elsevier

  abstract =                   {{Nanoporous anodic titanium oxide (ATO) layers with different cell sizes,
   pore diameters and the thicknesses are successfully grown by three-step
   self-organized anodization in ethylene glycol containing 0.38 wt\% of
   NH4F and 1.79 wt\% of H2O at applied potential differences ranging from
   30 V to 70 V at various electrolyte temperatures. A relatively high
   growth speed (about 40 mu m h(-1)) of nanopore arrays is achieved at 30
   degrees C under the potential difference of 70 V. The morphology and the
   structure of ATO layers are directly affected by anodizing conditions,
   especially temperature and potential difference. It was found that the
   oxide thickness and the cell size are linearly dependent on anodizing
   potential difference. On the other hand, the anodizing temperature in
   the range of 10-30 degrees C does not affect the cell size in ATO films.
   Analyses of the pore diameter, pore circularity and regularity of the
   pore arrangement suggests that nanoporous anodic titania with the best
   pore arrangement can be formed in a controlled manner by anodization
   performed at 50 V and 20 degrees C. Surprisingly, below and above this
   critical potential difference and temperature, pore diameters are
   smaller and obtained ATO structures are less regular. At higher
   anodizing temperatures, the regularity of pore arrangement observed at
   the surface and the pore diameter are considerably affected by the
   precipitated hydrous titanium dioxide. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   self-assemble into ordered configurations. For more than 60 years it has
   been assumed that field-assisted dissolution of the oxide leads to pore
   formation, despite a lack of direct experimental evidence that confirms
   this expectation. In this work, we have developed a method for
   separately studying the onset of field induced growth instabilities and
   the instability that leads to pore formation. We find that
   field-assisted dissolution models are consistent with the observed
   dependence of the Al2O3 dissolution rate on the electric field, as well
   as the existence of a critical field for pore initiation. However, we
   further show that the well-known porous structure, which has a
   significantly different length scale, does not result from a
   field-induced instability, but is instead the result of a mechanical
   instability with forced plastic deformation and flow of the oxide during
   further anodization. Through interpretation of these results we develop
   a generalized mechanism for pore formation in MO, and by analogy, for
   pore formation in other anodization processes. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

   as supercapacitor electrode materials, their poor electronic
   conductivity embarrasses the practical applications. Here, we develop a
   simple electrochemical doping method to significantly improve the
   electronic conductivity and the electrochemical performances of TiO2
   nanotube electrodes. These TiO2 nanotube electrodes treated by the
   electrochemical hydrogenation doping (TiO2-H) exhibit a very high
   average specific capacitance of 20.08 mF cm(-2) at a current density of
   0.05 mA cm(-2), 20 times more than the pristine TiO2 nanotube
   electrodes. The improved electrochemical performances can be attributed
   to ultrahigh conductivity of TiO2-H due to the introduction of
   interstitial hydrogen ions and oxygen vacancies by the doping. The
   supercapacitor device assembled by the doped electrodes delivers a
   specific capacitance of 5.42 mF cm(-2) and power density of 27.66 mW
   cm(-2), on average, at the current density of 0.05 mA cm(-2). The device
   also shows an outstanding rate capability with 60\% specific capacitance
   retained when the current density increases from 0.05 to 4.00 mA cm(-2).
   More interestingly, the electrochemical performances of the
   supercapacitor after cycling can be recovered by the same doping
   process. This strategy boosts the performances of the supercapacitor,
   especially cycling stability. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   anodic alumina (PAA) are discussed in detail. The anodizing current J(T)
   within the oxide includes ionic current j(ion) and electronic current
   j(e) during the anodizing process. The j(ion) is used to form an oxide
   and the j(e) is used to give rise to oxygen gas or sparking. The j(e)
   results from the impurity centers within the oxide. For a given
   electrolyte, the j(e) is dependent on the impurity centers and
   independent of the J(T). The formation of nanopores can be ascribed to
   the oxygen evolution within the oxide. Oxygen gas will begin to be
   released at the critical thickness d(c). The manner of the development
   of PAA is in accordance with that of BAA. The differences between PAA
   and BAA are the magnitude of j(e) or the continuity of oxygen evolution.
   There are two competitive reactions, i.e. oxide growth (2Al(3+) + 3O(2-)
   -> Al(2)O(3)) and oxygen evolution (2O(2-) -> O(2)up arrow + 4e). The
   former keeps the wall of the channel lengthened, the latter keeps the

   experimental and theoretical approaches. Current transients are recorded
   to study real-time morphological evolution of anodic TiO2 films during
   anodization at high and low voltages (V-high, V-low). Current changes
   after each voltage ramp to V-high are observed along with sequential
   origination of pits, pores and tubes in a compact barrier layer at the
   base of oxide film. Two anodization steps at V-high separated by one
   step at V-low with equal holding time yield double-layer smooth-walled
   TiO2 nanotubes. However, repetition of this sequence does not produce
   nanotubes of more layers, but makes lower-layer nanotubes longer and
   induces ridges on their walls to form bamboo-type tubes. Formation
   mechanisms of double-layer TiO2 consisting of smooth-walled or
   bamboo-type nanotubes are explored. A proper holding time of low-voltage
   anodization is required for ridge formation, but ridge spacing is
   determined by high-voltage anodization time. The ridge spacing increases
   linearly with the high-voltage anodization time, and can be
   theoretically calculated for lower-layer bamboo-type nanotubes formed in
   EG electrolytes with 5 vol\% H2O. Less water (2 vol\%) in electrolyte
   results in larger ridge spacing, while more water (10-15 vol\%) not only
   reduces the ridge spacing, but also causes instability during growth of
   multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays and eventually leads to formation of a
   disordered porous TiO2 structure. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   wall of anodized TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) prepared in a NaF/Glycerol
   electrolyte containing 2 wt\% of water. The effect of potential and time
   on the morphology of the NTs is evaluated along with growth efficiency
   (\% of total charge at the electrode used to form the oxide) and X-ray
   Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) measurements, providing an insight into
   the mechanism of formation of ribs. XPS analysis confirms the presence
   of fluorine, as TiF62-, and carbon as impurities in the anodic film. The
   growth efficiency of the process decreases from similar to 70\% at 10V
   to 55-58\% at 20-30V and 14\% at 40 V. Similarly, the anodic growth
   factor (migration of ions expressed as the maximum radius of the ``oxide
   cell{''} per applied potential, nm V-1) decreases at higher potentials,
   due to oxygen bubbles evolving at the anode at 20-40 V and disrupting
   the anodizing process. The formation of gas bubbles also affects the
   morphology of the NTs; while NTs are smooth at 10 V, oxide rings appear
   over the range 20-40 V. Partial dissolution of the oxide rings due to
   fluorine ions eventually re-shapes the NTs forming ribs, whereas
   excessive dissolution over extended anodizing times tends to smoothen
   the NTs and eventually leads to collapse of the NTs. On the basis of
   these observations, we suggest oxygen evolution (requiring a minimum
   amount of water in the electrolyte and a sufficiently high potential
   20-40V) plays a primary role on the formation of ribs on anodized TiO2
   NTs. Ribs are also observed on NTs grown in aqueous electrolytes,
   although since dissolution is more difficult to control the resulting
   structure is more irregular than in organic media. (C) 2012 Elsevier

   three-step anodization process in glycerol-based electrolyte containing
   0.38 wt.\% NH4F and 1.79 wt.\% H2O. The effects of applied potential
   (10-70 V), duration of the third step of anodization (15,30 and 60 min)
   and the previous usage of the electrolyte on formation of ATO layers
   were examined at the anodizing temperature of 40 degrees C. It was found
   that at 10V in both the fresh and used electrolytes, the porous layers
   are observed for short anodizing times and the compact oxide layers were
   formed when the time was extended to 60 min. On the other hand, the
   uneven oxide layers were obtained at 70V. The structure and surface
   morphology analyses showed that for the fresh electrolyte the pore
   diameter increases with increasing anodizing potential and time.
   However, for the used electrolyte the pore diameter increases with
   potential and decreases or remains constant with time. The latter one is
   attributed to the enhanced precipitation of hydrous titanium dioxide on
   the ATO surface. The precipitation of hydrous titanium dioxide is also
   confirmed by oxide thickness analyses performed for the fresh and used
   electrolytes. The current density-time plots showed that usage of the
   previously used electrolyte leads to retardation of the oxide formation
   as a result of partial depletion of the fluoride ions from the
   electrolyte. These results were confirmed by measurements of the
   electrolyte conductance. The calculated efficiency of the anodization
   process, based on the thickness of the oxide layers, are significantly
   higher for the fresh electrolyte than for the used one. (C) 2014

   particularly in the initial tube generation stage. The two-step Ti
   substrate has ordered hexagonally distributed dimples which play the
   role of template for the formation of new TiO2 NTs. As a result, the
   TiO2 NTs grown via a two-step anodization approach have highly ordered

   Addition of water resulted in an increased current and significantly
   reduced tube length associated with increased oxygen gas evolution.
   Films formed in the absence of added water were amorphous by electron
   diffraction, whereas water addition also led to the formation of anatase
   and rutile. The barrier layer was relatively thin for electrolyte of low
   water content, due to either a voltage drop in the electrolyte close to
   the anode or to a change in the film composition affecting the electric
   field across the layer. Ribbing of the external walls of the nanotubes
   was more evident in the presence of water. It is suggested that
   dissolution of a fluoride-rich layer, which separates the nanotubes,
   accompanies the nanotube growth, with the dissolution allowing transient
   film formation at the external walls of the nanotubes when the residual
   layer is sufficiently thin. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.}},

   a model for steady-state growth of these amorphous films, incorporating
   the novel feature that metal and oxygen ions are transported by coupled
   electrical migration and viscous flow. The oxide flow in the model
   arises near the film-solution interface at the pore bottoms, in response
   to the constraint of volume conservation. The hypothesis of viscous flow
   was successfully validated through detailed comparisons to observations
   of the motion of tungsten tracers in the film. Predictions of localized
   tensile stress near nanoscale ridges at the metal-film interface were
   supported by observations of voids at these sites. We suggest that the
   ordering of PAA may be explained by a mechanism in which metal-film
   interface motion is regulated by the combination of ionic migration in
   the oxide and stress-driven interface diffusion of metal atoms.}},

   received considerable attention because of their applications in a
   number of fields. The formation mechanisms of nanopores and nanotubes in
   these porous anodic oxides, however, have remained unclear until now.
   The interactions between porous structural features and current-time
   transients in anodizing process cannot be successfully explained. Based
   on the mechanism of dielectric breakdown of the compact anodic alumina
   (CAA), the differences and internal relations in their forming processes
   between CAA and PAA are contrasted in detail. From this innovative
   standpoint, according to the divergence of PAA and CAA in their
   current-time curves (or voltage-time curves), two essential causes which
   induce the decrease of the forming efficiency of oxide in the anodizing
   process, that is, the generation of the electronic current and the
   oxygen evolution, are presented in the paper. The evidences of the round
   hollows within the CAA films, show that the regularly embryo pores
   result from the oxygen bubbles. According to the aluminum anodizing in
   the mixed-electrolyte, the results show that once oxygen evolution
   stopping, the pore growth must be stopped, and the pores must be sealed
   by the above compact oxide. A novel composite film of the anodic oxide
   is presented. All of the above conclusively show that in the forming
   process of PAA, an appropriate magnitude of electronic current ensures
   the oxygen evolution and the pores formation, an appropriate magnitude
   of ionic current ensures the oxide formation and growth of pore walls.}},

   years. However, the growth kinetics still remains unclear, because it is
   hardly derived by direct in situ methods. Here, an interesting approach
   is proposed to overcome this challenge. A combinatorial anodization was
   exploited to monitor the pore initiation and nanotube growth under a
   preformed compact surface layer (CSL). The preformed CSL and the NTs
   under the CSL (UCSL-NTs) were formed in fluoride-free and
   fluoride-containing electrolytes, respectively. The forming process of
   UCSL-NTs was discussed as compared with that of the general NTs, mainly
   focusing on the differences of current-time curves and electric charge
   quantity (Coulomb). The results show that pore embryos of UCSL-NTs have
   already been achieved under the CSL before the CSL is dissolved. There
   are five stages in the current-time curve of UCSL-NTs, which is
   significantly different from three stages of the general NTs. A new
   growth model, based on a comprehensive review of the existing theories,
   is proposed to explain the current decrease and increase. And the
   forming process of TiO2 NTs is considered to be dominated by the oxide
   plastic flow around the oxygen bubbles. (C) 2014 The Electrochemical

   A novel and not easily brittle nanostructure, called triple-layered TiO2
   nanotube array, has been fabricated by changing the electrolytes during
   the electrochemical anodizing processes. The first porous layer was
   fabricated in fluoride-containing electrolyte, the middle compact layer
   was formed in fluoride-free electrolyte and the second porous layer was
   formed in the same fluoride-containing electrolyte. The results show
   that middle compact layer becomes thicker with the increase of the third
   time anodizing voltage. At the same time, it needs more time for the
   fourth time anodization to reach the equilibrium current, where the
   nanotubes begin to develop steadily. Furthermore, a possible mechanism
   for the growth of the triple-layered nanotubes is discussed by
   comparison with the normal PATNT. The present results may be helpful to
   understand the mechanism of PATNT and facilitate assembling diverse
   nanostructures for extensive applications in photocatalysis,
   dye-sensitized solar cells, and biomedical devices. (C) 2013 The

   years. However, their mysterious formation mechanism still remains
   unclear. The formation of gaps and ribs around the nanotubes has not
   been elucidated. Here, various surface and cross-section morphologies of
   ATNTs obtained under different anodizing conditions and their evolution
   process have been investigated in detail. Based on many experimental
   facts, new explanations for the gaps and ribs are presented. An entire
   surface layer covered on the nanotubes plays a primary role on the
   formation of gaps and ribs. The gaps result from the radial distribution
   of the electric field at the pore bottom. No newly-formed oxide will
   exist along the gap direction, because the electric filed along the gap
   is the minimum. The ribs result from the electrolyte entering into the
   wider gaps among the ATNTs due to the rupture of the entire surface
   layer. The rings or ribs on the outer wall of ATNTs are formed at the
   electrolyte/Ti interface due to the discontinuous existence of a small
   amount of electrolyte within the gap base. The present viewpoint was
   demonstrated by an original micro-dam, which can block the electrolyte
   entering into the gaps and avoid the formation of ribs. (C) The

   However, the growth kinetics still remains unclear. The systematic study
   of the current transient under constant anodizing voltage has not been
   mentioned in the original literature. Here, a derivation and its
   corresponding theoretical formula are proposed to overcome this
   challenge. In this paper, the theoretical expressions for the time
   dependent ionic current and electronic current are derived to explore
   the anodizing process of Ti. The anodizing current-time curves under
   different anodizing voltages and different temperatures are
   experimentally investigated in the anodization of Ti. Furthermore, the
   quantitative relationship between the thickness of the barrier layer and
   anodizing time, and the relationships between the ionic/electronic
   current and temperatures are proposed in this paper. All of the
   current-transient plots can be fitted consistently by the proposed
   theoretical expressions. Additionally, it is the first time that the
   coefficient A of the exponential relationship (ionic current j(ion) = A
   exp(BE)) has been determined under various temperatures and voltages.
   And the results indicate that as temperature and voltage increase, ionic
   current and electronic current both increase. The temperature has a
   larger effect on electronic current than ionic current. These results
   can promote the research of kinetics from a qualitative to quantitative

   profiles of the in-plane stress in the oxide were measured by in-situ
   monitoring of stress change during open circuit dissolution following
   anodizing. During barrier oxide growth prior to pore formation,
   compressive stress accumulated to several GPa within a 3-5 nm thick

   was relaxed. Oxide composition measurements revealed elevated
   concentrations of incorporated phosphate ions in the same region,
   indicating that stress is generated by field-driven anion incorporation.
   Pores initiate when surface stress reaches a maximum, and is accompanied

   are created by a flow instability caused by spatially nonuniform
   near-surface compressive stress. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

   ranging from catalysts and electrodes to sensors or biomaterials. Many
   patents and scientific papers are devoted to a range of manufacturing
   approaches commonly involving multistep processing under harsh
   conditions, lacking general applicability and bearing the potential for
   contamination. Here we demonstrate the fabrication of porous metal
   layers by anodization at moderate voltages in highly concentrated acids.
   Porous metal layers were produced on copper, silver, iron and nickel
   using 99\% phosphoric and sulfuric acids. The porous layer thickness can
   be tuned up to over one micrometer. Structures develop in 4 to 30
   minutes independent of substrate purity or crystallographic features.
   The mechanism is believed to involve templated etching due to a
   near-stagnant bubble layer in a highly viscous electrolyte near the
   anode. It is therefore not dependent on any particular chemistry, as
   long as anodic oxygen bubbles are evolved at a sufficient rate. Since
   the principal processes of electropolishing are still operational, the
   surfaces remain flat at a larger scale, even though the optical
   properties ( reflectivity, SERS activity) have changed significantly.
   Our method is reproducible, cheap, clean, fast and versatile, leading to
   a wider range of applications for porous metal surfaces. (C) 2012 The

  abstract =                   {{This paper reviews the state of the art of anodized titanium dioxide
   nanotubes (TiO2 NTs), with an emphasis on the growth mechanism leading
   to their formation and the effect of heat treatment on their structure
   and properties. The discussion is primarily focused on TiO2 NTs grown in
   fluoride containing electrolytes, although the mechanism of formation of
   NTs in fluoride free solutions via Rapid Breakdown Anodization (RBA) is
   briefly covered. After an initial overview of progress made on the
   synthesis of anodized TiO2 NTs the review provides an analysis of the
   factors affecting the anodizing process (fluoride concentration,
   electrolyte type, applied potential and anodizing time). Details of the
   current-time transient, the chemistry of the process and the chemical
   composition of the anodic films are described which provide key
   information to unveil the nanotube growth mechanism. The main debate is
   whether NTs growth in fluoride containing solutions occurs via
   field-assisted plastic flow (i.e. a constant upward displacement of the
   oxide to form the NTs) combined with field-assisted ejection of the Ti4+
   ions (i.e. ions are ejected into the electrolyte without oxide
   formation) or via field-assisted dissolution (i.e. preferential
   dissolution at the pore base where the field is stronger) or whether
   both processes play a role. Whenever anodization takes place in organic
   solutions the experimental evidence supports the plastic flow model,
   whereas in aqueous media field-assisted (and chemical) dissolution
   occur. The mechanism of rib formation on the walls of the NTs is also
   reviewed, and it clearly emerges that the applied potential and water
   content in the electrolyte are key factors in determining whether the
   NTs are ribbed or smooth. There also appears to be a relationship
   between the presence of ribs and the evolution of oxygen bubbles at the
   anode. The impact of thermal treatment on the properties of the NTs is
   also described. A variety of crystalline structures are present in the
   NTs (i.e. anatase or rutile), depending on the heat treatment
   temperature and atmosphere and the resulting electrical properties can
   be varied from dielectric to semi-metallic. A heat treatment temperature
   limit ranging from 500 to 800 degrees C exists, depending on preparation
   history, above which sintering of nanoscale titania particles occurs
   leading to collapse of the NTs structure. Future work should aim at
   using annealing not just to influence the resulting crystalline phase,
   but also for generating defects to be exploited in specific applications
   (i.e. photocatalysis, water splitting and photovoltaics). (C) 2013

   of Ti in a glycerol-based electrolyte containing 0.5\% wt of sodium
   fluoride (NaF). The influence of anodisation voltage and anodisation
   time on nanotube wall thickness, diameter and length has been
   investigated. The results indicate that nanotubes can be formed within a
   voltage range 10-40 V and that the tubular structure is lost when using
   a higher voltage. The diameter of the nanotubes is voltage dependent,
   with the widest tubes being obtained at the highest possible applied
   voltage of 40 V. An initial voltage ramp which increases at 100 mV/s to
   the anodisation voltage, rather than an instantaneous step, was observed
   to stabilise the metal-oxide interface. This enabled the growth of
   anodic films up to 5.5 mu m in length by anodising for approximately 48
   h. In the absence of a voltage ramp the films tended to collapse and
   become detached from the titanium electrode after 15-20 h. Electron
   microscopy observation suggests that the nanotubes in glycerol develop
   in a similar way to those produced in water-based media. The nanotubes
   formed using glycerol also exhibit ripples along the tube wall,
   although, growing at a slower rate, they are generally smoother than
   those formed in water.}},

   The current challenge is the difficulty on tailoring hollow
   nanoarchitectures with well-controlled morphology at a relatively low
   cost. As a conventional technique, electrochemistry exhibits its unique
   advantage on machining nanostructures. In this review, we present the
   progress of electrochemistry as a valuable tool in construction of novel
   hollow nanoarchitectures through pulse/step anodization, such as surface
   pre-texturing, modulated, branched and multilayered pore architectures,
   and free-standing membranes. Basic principles for electrochemical
   engineering of mono-or multi-ordered nanostructures as well as
   free-standing membranes are extracted from specific examples (i.e.
   porous silicon, aluminum and titanium oxide). The potential of such
   nanoarchitectures are further demonstrated for the applications of
   photovoltaics, water splitting, organic degradation, nanostructure
   templates, biosensors and drug release. The electrochemical techniques
   provide a powerful approach to produce nanostructures with morphological

   method. In the present work, different morphologies formed under
   different anodizing voltages are investigated in detail by
   field-emission scanning electron microscope. The results show that the
   concaves left by the first-step anodization can guide the uniform growth
   of TNAs in some degree as the second-step anodizing voltage is the same
   with that in the first step, however, when lower voltages are adopted in
   the second-step anodization, no guidance can be achieved, and different
   morphological TNAs with lotus-root-shaped nanostructure are fabricated.
   And we find that the nanotube diameters are directly proportional to the
   applied voltage in the second-step anodization. Furthermore, a possible
   mechanism for the growth of the TiO2 nanotubes with the special
   morphology is proposed for the first time, which depends on both the
   oxygen bubble mold and the viscous flow of the barrier oxide from the
   pore base to the pore wall. (c) 2013 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.}},

   self-organized oxide layer, which protects the surface from corrosion
   and prevents ion release, are widely accepted as biocompatible metal
   implants. Surface modification is essential for the promotion of the
   osseointegration of these biomaterials. Nanotubes fabricated on the
   surface of metal implants by anodization are receiving ever-increasing
   attention for surface modification. This paper provides an overview of
   the employment of anodization for nanotubes fabricated on the surface of
   titanium, titanium alloys and titanium alloying metals such as niobium,
   tantalum and zirconium metal implants. This work explains anodic
   oxidation and the manner by which nanotubes form on the surface of the
   metals. It then assesses this topical research to indicate how changes
   in anodizing conditions influence nanotube characteristics such as tube
   diameters and nanotube-layer thickness. Crown Copyright (c) 2012

   exceeds two. Experimentally measured efficiencies, over diverse

  abstract =                   {{High-aspect-ratio TiO2 nanotube arrays formed by anodic oxidation have
   drawn extensive attention due to their easy fabrication and various
   excellent optical, electrical and biomedical properties. In contrast to
   conventional single-layer TiO2 nanotubes prepared via constant-voltage
   anodization, we synthesize multilayer TiO2 nanotube arrays with high
   surface area by using alternating-voltage anodization steps. This work
   presents synthesis and growth mechanisms of single-layer smooth TiO2
   nanotubes, bamboo-type nanotubes and double-layer nanotubes, by tuning
   various parameters such as voltage, time, and water content in the
   electrolyte. It is found that ion diffusion inside the nanotubes
   dominates growth of these three structures. A stable pH and
   ion-diffusion profile allows the steady growth of smooth TiO2 tubes in
   NH4F-containing ethylene glycol (EG). The addition of a low-voltage
   anodization step reduces the pH and ion-diffusion gradient in the
   nanotubes and induces formation of bamboo-type nanotubes and
   double-layer nanotubes when a second high-voltage anodization is
   conducted. Ion diffusion through a nanotube takes time; thus formation
   of lower-layer TO2 nanotubes costs more time if longer nanotubes are
   grown in the upper layer, since ions diffuse through these longer
   nanotubes. This ion-diffusion controlled growth mechanism is further
   confirmed by tailoring the water content (0-20 vol\%) in the electrolyte
   and the voltage gaps to control the time needed for initiation of
   lower-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays. The fundamental understanding of the
   growth characteristics of double-layer TiO2 nanotubes presented in this
   paper offers us more flexibility in engineering morphology, tuning
   dimensions and phase compositions of multilayer TiO2 nanotubes. In
   addition, we synthesize double-layer TiO2 nanotube arrays composed of
   one layer of anatase phase and another layer of amorphous phase.}},

   TiO2 nanotubes (NTs) is here established and compared with the classical
   metal oxidation theory from Mott and Cabrera. The role of delta(b) in
   the anodization of TiO2 NTs under different applied potentials and times
   was analyzed using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM).
   Contrary to the well-known case of anodic aluminum oxide, we found that
   delta(b) of TiO2 NTs progressively grows over time due to the nonsteady
   anodization regime. We then establish a relation between the
   phenomenological growth of the barrier layer with time and applied
   voltage, delta(b)(V,t) using the high-field Mott and Cabrera conduction
   theory. The developed model was found to be in excellent agreement with
   the experimental data from both STEM and anodization curves. On the
   basis of these results, the relationship between delta(b) and the
   anodization time and potential can now be quantitatively understood.}},

   current in Ti anodization by adding deep eutectic solvent (DES) of
   2-10\% to a fluoride-containing electrolyte; nanobamboos (NBs), i.e.,
   nanotubes decorated with periodic exterior rings, were formed by the
   DES-assisted anodization. Spontaneous formation of NBs occurred upon
   application of a constant 20 V voltage, together with a self-induced
   current oscillation that corresponds well to the NB structures. The
   initial voltage must be higher than a threshold of approximately 14 V to
   induce the self-organization of the NBs. Once a dense layer of TiO2 is
   formed at 10 V or lower, formation of the NBs is suppressed even when a
   higher voltage (above 15 V) is applied. The NBs formed with the
   spontaneous current oscillation were densely packed (ca. 1.54 x 10(10)
   cm(-2)) with each NB possessing many rings spaced 20-35 nm apart. The
   thickness of each ring was ca. 10 nm. By increasing the DES
   concentration to 10 wt\%, the diameter of the NBs increased from 45 to
   110 nm and their growth rate increased from 0.16 to 0.3 mu m/h. The
   spontaneous current oscillation we observed differs from the
   conventional electrochemical oscillation because (1) oscillation period
   is quite long (7 min) and (2) the oscillation results in the periodic
   modulation of TiO2 NBs. The self-organized nanobaoboos were
   characterized for various anodization conditions, and a mechanism was
   proposed with the basis of the high conductivity and high viscosity of
   DES. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.}},
